Blip: Very Simple Geolocation
====

Blip is a very simple JSON based user information API, powered by Google App Engine.

Just hit http://blip.runway7.net - it gives you Google's best guess about where you are in JSON.

If like Blip but don't want to rely on the Runway 7 instance, feel free to deploy your own - just change the application name in `app.yml` and follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/uploading).
